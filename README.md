==========
A silly snake/troncycle game heavily inspired by [Armagetron](http://www.armagetronad.net "Armagetron website").

Primary reason for the existence of this game is for me to learn about javascript and sort of modern web development. Not sure where this is heading.

One reasonably updated live version is located at <http://kingsofthegrid.net/lackattack/>.
